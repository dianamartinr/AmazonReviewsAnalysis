# AmazonReviewsAnalysis
 
In this project, first we aims to predict whether the customer will return the product or not based on the customer review. Second, we identify whether there is any item on their stock that customer find disappointing. 

We use several techniques as sentiment analysis, who is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand if the customer reviews are positive or negative.

We explore how well machine learning algorithms perform when given the task to predict a returned product. 

We propose a dissapointed score to measure how much a product could be dissappointed based on the probabilities that the customer reviews and ratings are negatives and the probability that the product could be returned.
